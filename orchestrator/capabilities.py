"""Capability vocabulary and the deterministic provider registry.

Phase 0 orchestration: every implemented capability resolves to exactly one
registered provider. Known-but-unimplemented capabilities stay listed for
truthful reporting but never resolve to a provider, so unsupported requests
can never fall through to VQA.

Providers carry identity metadata; runtime readiness comes from the model in
the existing name-keyed registry, which remains the execution interface.
